M.P.1
Detects 4 out of 5 of landmines in a grassy field
A high level of detection accuracy is required, and this is a suitable goal for developmental testing
M.P.2
Detects landmines with a false to true positives ratio of no more than 2:1
Minimizing the number of false positives will increase the rate of coverage
M.P.3
Detonates zero landmines during probing action
The system should not trigger a landmine to detonate during detection
M.P.4
Physically marks landmine location to an accuracy of 10cm
The accuracy of this process is critical as the marked location is used by deminers
M.P.5
Physically marks covered area to an accuracy of 10cm
This accuracy is critical as it allows the surveyor to visually confirm covered area
M.P.6
Warns user of potential hazards within 0.25s
If potential landmine is detected, the operator must immediately be warned
M.P.7
Surveys land at a rate of 0.05 m2/s  in an area known to be free of metallic objects

D.P.1
Determines whether a detection is a true or false positive within 5 minutes
Detection must occur at a reasonable rate to minimize coverage time
D.P.2
Records landmine location on digital Dig Sheet to an accuracy of 50cm
Digital mapping accuracy is less important than physical marking
D.P.3
Records area covered by system to an accuracy of 50cm
Digital mapping accuracy is less important than physical marking


M.N.1
Able to be operated continuously for 1hr
This will allow sufficient time for testing and demonstration purposes
M.N.2
Costs less than $5000
This is a sufficient cost level for field adoption, and fits in the MRSD budget constraints

D.N.1
Weighs less than 50kg
The system should be able to be handled by two people
D.N.2
Is able to make 180Â° pin turns
This will allow for maneuverability of the system during operation
