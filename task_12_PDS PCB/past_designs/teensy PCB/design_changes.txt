The PCB should do:

1) motor control 
	- able to tune with everything plugged in
	- motor_enable and motor_pwm

2) power measurement - i2c

3) magnetic encoder - SPI

4) quadrature decoder - digital





DONE 1) 5V power supply using USB is switched
	- just use V_in?
	- it will have to be battery to ensure stability
	- change in eagle
	- solder bridge to choose using Vsys or USB plug

DONE 2) level shifters
	- use premade ones, don't act cool
	- 3.3 to 5 should be good enough
	- use TXS0108PWR, which has leads even though it is slightly bigger, easier to handle
	- change the eagle file
	- follow the sparkfun GPIO_block schematic for level shifting, only capacitors, OE tied to 1.8v already
	- 1.8v 1 cap each, reference also 1 cap each, 0.1uF
	- OE just ties to 1.8V

DONE 3) motor controller USB port
	- make sure enough clearance, right now hits the encoder wires
	- encoder wires keep near to front
	- found a right-angled one, add it onto the PCB if have space
	- switch it around so the connector is in front
	
DONE 4) output cables
	- make all output cables face one direction

DONE 5) test pads
	- install more test pads
	- 5V, OE_shifter, PWM, motor_enable, SPI, for oscilloscope in the future
	NO TIME - test LEDs too, to show something is working

DONE 6) testing
	DONE - power measurement
	
	CMI - magnetic encoder
	
	DONE - quadrature decoder

	DONE - motor

DONE 7) hirose pins make them longer, can't place properly
	- change the eagle file

DONE 8) shift 16 way magnetic encoder to more center

DONE 9) 	- if have time, increase TVS diode size in eagle

DONE 10) quadrature decoder, do not attach channelI
	- it drifts by a high number of counts
	- change clock? 33Mhz
	- unattach CHI
	- add solder pads to join in case needed

DONE 10) spi
	- PA0 is missing
	
DONE 11) soldering
	- capacitors might be shorted
